          Lanza y Oso—"Spear and Bear"—captures the essence of my name, Gerardo Garcia, and the spirit of my creative
          journey. The name Gerardo traces back to Germanic roots, with ger meaning “spear” and hard meaning “brave” or
          “strong.” Together, the name symbolizes courage and strength, an identity steeped in resilience and purpose.
          Garcia, meanwhile, is a Spanish surname with origins in the Basque country, where it often means “bear” or
          “young warrior.” This heritage blends both strength and instinct, qualities that lie at the heart of my art
          studio, Lanza y Oso. </p>
        <p>
          I created Lanza y Oso as a way to communicate what I find so difficult to capture in words. Art, to me, is the
          purest form of expression—a way to reveal the parts of myself I’d otherwise struggle to explain. Words often
          fall short of conveying the depth of what I see and feel; they dilute my message and make it harder for me to
          share my true vision. Art, however, speaks without limits. Through each piece, I share a part of myself that
          would remain hidden if left to language alone.</p>
        <p>
          Lanza y Oso is a space for embracing this side of myself, and I hope it becomes a place where others can
          connect
          to their own creativity and inner voice. Here, I aim to help people find their own way of communicating the
          inexpressible, of experiencing and sharing their truths without the need for words. In art, we find a freedom
          and clarity that lets us express what lies beyond language, and in doing so, we connect with others in a
          deeply
          authentic way.
