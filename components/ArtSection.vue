      <p class="m-auto w-3/4">In Lanza y Oso, I work with a variety of media—linocuts, oils, acrylics, screen prints,
        and digital tools—to
        create a layered form of communication. Each medium has its own voice: linocuts capture raw textures and bold
        contrasts, grounding my work in tactile, almost primal imagery. Oil and acrylic paints allow for depth and
        movement, blending hues that evoke mood and emotion in ways words simply can’t. Screen printing brings a
        precision and rhythm to my work, lending itself to themes of repetition and subtle variation, while digital
        tools let me experiment with structure and fluidity, pushing my ideas into new and often unexpected forms. By
        combining these techniques, I’m able to communicate not just a single message, but a spectrum of thoughts and
        feelings—offering viewers a piece of myself without the need for words.</p>
